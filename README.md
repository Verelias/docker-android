This is a fork of the docker-android project by faberNovel tailored for a smaller footprint and more efficient building.
docker-android-alpine provides general purpose docker images to run CI steps of Android project.
Docker allows you to provide a replicable environment, which does not change with the host machine or the CI service.
It should work out of the box on any CI/CD service providing docker support.
The image is providing standard tools to build and test Android application:
* Android SDK
* Java JDK 17
* Google Cloud CLI, to support [Firebase Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab)

## CI/CD service support
